# FaceRecognition
This repository presents a face recognition system trained using two loss functions—contrastive and triplet—across six models. For each loss type, three models were developed, including one with pretrained weights, to compare performance.


## Dataset License and Usage

This project uses the [Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) for face recognition research. 

### Agreement
The CelebA dataset is available for non-commercial research purposes only. By using this dataset, you agree:
- Not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, resell, or exploit any part of the images or derived data for commercial purposes.
- Not to further copy, publish, or distribute any portion of the dataset, except for internal use at a single site within the same organization.
